You will be given a question along with a list of 15-100 Cisco IOS-XE commands. Your task is to select one command from the provided list that is in the EXACT format as presented. Do not modify or add any options to the command. Your selection must be based on the command that provides the most relevant and meaningful output in response to the user's query.

Follow these guidelines:
1. **Use Only Provided Commands:** Select a command only from the provided list WITHOUT ANY ALTERATIONS. 
2. **Exact Format:** Ensure the selected command is in the exact format as listed. Do not add, remove, or change any options or parameters, doing so causes a CRITICAL system level FAILURE.
3. **Relevance:** Choose the command that best answers the user's query. If none of the commands are suitable or the query is illogical and unanswerable, respond with "None" as the value of the 'selected_command' key.

The query will be provided below as:
QUERY: ```{query}```

The list of commands will be provided below as:
COMMANDS: ```{commands}```

Your output should be in JSON format like this:

  "selected_command": "selected_command_here"

You will be provided with documentation and a question to validate a network command. The documentation will detail a specific Cisco IOS XE command and its output. Your goal is to evaluate the provided question and determine if the command can definitively provide the required output based on the documentation. Follow these specific rules:

1. **Direct Match**: BE STRICT. The command and its output in the documentation must directly answer the question without requiring any interpretation or assumptions.

2. **Output Fields**: Verify that the necessary fields or data points mentioned in the question are explicitly listed in the command's output as described in the documentation.

3. **Command Scope**: Ensure the command's scope and functionality, as described, align exactly with what is needed to answer the question. If the command only partially covers the required information, it is invalid.

4. **Examples and Use Cases**: Check if the documentation includes examples or use cases that match the scenario described in the question. If no such examples are provided, the command is invalid.

5. **Ambiguity**: If there is any ambiguity or lack of clarity in the documentation regarding the commandâ€™s ability to answer the question, consider the command invalid.

6. **Additional Steps**: If the documentation suggests additional steps or commands are necessary to obtain the answer, the original command is considered invalid.

You will be given the question as QUESTION: ```[question]```, and documentation as DOCUMENTATION: ```[documentation]```

QUESTION: ```{question}```

DOCUMENTATION: ```{documentation}```

Your output should be in JSON format, with the key "valid_command" and the value being a boolean. For example: "valid_command": false

You will be given a user's question along with documentation for a command that will be used to answer the user's question. Your task is to use the provided documentation to construct a command that accurately answers the user's question. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Provided Documentation:** Use only the options and information from the provided documentation to construct the command. Do not use external information. THIS STEP IS CRITICAL
2. **No Assumptions:** Do not make any assumptions about the router or network environment where the command will be executed. Avoid using placeholder values such as routing process IDs unless explicitly mentioned in the documentation.
3. **Command Completion:** Ensure the command you construct includes all necessary options to provide the correct output for the user's question.
4. **Output Format:** Provide the completed command in JSON format with the key `precise_command`.
5. **Single command output:** Ensure the command you provide back to the user is only a single command that if ran on a cisco ios device as-is, would not throw any errors.

The provided documentation will be provided below as:
DOCUMENTATION: ```{documentation}```

The user's question will be provided below as:

You will be provided a query from a user about a network problem. Your job is to create and ask a single straightforward question, OR determine if the question is already answered. Your question is directed at the network, not at the user. 

Follow these guidelines:
1. **Question Selection:** Your question must be a small part of the overall question, limit your question to be only about one specific technology or feature.
2. **No Assumptions:** Do not make any assumptions or inferences about the user's intent beyond what is explicitly stated in the query.
3. **Extract formatting requests:** If any request is made to format the output of the document, you must omit that completely from your response. ex. 'output as csv'
4. **Question Selection Rule 2:** Do not ask repeat questions. Refer to final answer question -> answer pairs provided to you to determine what the next logical question is. or if the question is properly answered in the pairs already.
5. **Detail:** Ensure that your questions retain any important details (protocols, device names, probable cause) from the initial query and qa pairs. The questions you provide must be valid by themselves, assume the network handles these queries without any context.
6. **Determine Finish** If the qa pairs provided give a definitive answer and no future research is needed, set the more_questions key to False

The query will be provided below as:
QUERY: ```{query}```

The previously asked question and answer pairs will be provided below as:
QA_PAIRS: ```{qa_pairs}```

Your task includes generating a quick, direct summary of the troubleshooting so far based on the QA_PAIRS and QUERY. The summary should be concise and to the point.

Your output should be in JSON format. For example:

You will be provided with a question that references devices within your network topology. Your goal is to extract the relevant network devices from your known devices list that are specifically targeted in the question. Follow these specific rules:

1. **Device Identification**: Identify all devices mentioned in the question. Your provided question may include additional details, you should focus directly on the question at hand, ignore any extra details that do not directly reference the device(s).

2. **Case Insensitivity**: Treat device names as case-insensitive. The user might not use the exact case as the device names in your known devices list.

3. **Alias Recognition**: Recognize and correctly interpret aliases such as referencing C8K[number] routers as router [number].

4. **Exact Match**: Match the identified devices in the question against the known devices list. Ensure the names align with those in the known list, even if the user uses variations.

6. **Output Format**: Return the identified devices in JSON format, pulling the device tuples directly from the known devices list.

You will be given the question as QUESTION: ```[question]```, and your known device list as DEVICE_LIST: ```[device_list]```. The device list consists of a list of tuples, where index 0 is the hostname, and index 1 is the device's management IP address.
